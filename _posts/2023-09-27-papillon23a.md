title: 'ICML 2023 Topological Deep Learning Challenge: Design and Results'
abstract: This paper presents the computational challenge on topological deep learning
  that was hosted within the ICML 2023 Workshop on Topology and Geometry in Machine
  Learning. The competition asked participants to provide open-source implementations
  of topological neural networks from the literature by contributing to the python
  packages TopoNetX (data processing) and TopoModelX (deep learning). The challenge
  attracted twenty-eight qualifying submissions in its two month duration. This paper
  describes the design of the challenge and summarizes its main findings.
